# When designing a SaaS HR system that allows organizations to create their own HR platforms, 
# you'll need to consider various aspects, including authentication, authorization, data security, 
# and multi-tenancy. Here's a suggested approach to handle authentication and authorization in your 
# HR SaaS:

# """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""


# Authentication and Authorization Approach:

# Multi-Tenancy Architecture:
# Implement a multi-tenancy architecture where each organization (tenant) has its own isolated database
# and data space. This ensures that data from one organization is completely separate from another, maintaining 
# data privacy and security.

# User Registration and Onboarding:
# Provide a user registration and onboarding flow for organizations to sign up and create their HR platform. This 
# includes capturing organization-specific details and administrative user information.

# Organization Roles and Permissions:
# Define role-based access control (RBAC) for each organization. Roles like HR manager, employee, and admin will have 
# different permissions within the organization's HR platform.

# Authentication Mechanism:
# Offer multiple authentication mechanisms for organizations, such as username/password, social login, or 
# single sign-on (SSO). Ensure that user authentication is secure, and consider supporting multi-factor 
# authentication (MFA) for added security.

# Customizable Authorization Policies:
# Allow organizations to customize their own authorization policies based on their specific requirements. This could 
# include setting permissions for various user roles, defining data access restrictions, and configuring approval workflows.

# OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect Integration:
# Consider integrating OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect for external integrations and providing seamless authentication with other 
# applications and services.

# User Management and Admin Panel:
# Develop an admin panel for organizations to manage their users, roles, and permissions. This panel should also allow HR managers 
# to manage employee profiles and permissions within their organization.

# Secure Data Handling:
# Implement best practices for data encryption, secure data storage, and secure communication channels. Ensure that sensitive HR 
# data like personal information and payroll details are protected.

# Audit Logging and Activity Tracking:
# Implement audit logging and activity tracking to monitor user actions, log access attempts, and detect potential security breaches.

# Token-Based Authentication (JWT or JWT-like):
# Utilize token-based authentication, such as JSON Web Tokens (JWT) or similar mechanisms, to provide secure authentication and 
# minimize the need for frequent database queries during each request.

# Access Token and Refresh Token Management:
# Handle access token and refresh token management securely to prevent unauthorized access and ensure smooth user experience 
# with token renewal.
