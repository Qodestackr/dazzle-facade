Month 1: Foundations

Spend the first month focusing on building a strong foundation in data structures and basic algorithms.
Learn about arrays, strings, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.
Practice problems that involve basic data structure operations, searching, and sorting.
Familiarize yourself with common searching and sorting algorithms.
Month 2: Intermediate Level

In the second month, dive deeper into more advanced data structures and algorithms.
Learn about advanced tree algorithms (e.g., AVL trees, segment trees) and graph algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm, topological sorting).
Start exploring dynamic programming with basic problems and recursion.
Month 3: Advanced Level

The third month is dedicated to mastering dynamic programming and tackling more complex problems.
Practice a wide variety of dynamic programming problems, including problems with overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure.
Explore greedy algorithms and practice problems that involve making optimal choices at each step.
Study Plan Tips:

Dedicate a significant amount of time each day to practice problem-solving. Aim for at least 1-2 hours of focused practice.
Use a variety of online platforms and resources to access practice problems, tutorials, and explanations.
Join coding communities or participate in coding contests to challenge yourself and learn from others.
Keep track of your progress and celebrate your achievements along the way.
Don't get discouraged by setbacks or difficult problems. Stay persistent and keep pushing forward.

Reaching a high level of problem-solving and critical thinking in software development, and understanding how seniors achieve it, requires a combination of technical knowledge, experience, and mindset. Here are some strategies to help you reach this level:

Technical Knowledge: Build a strong foundation of technical knowledge in programming languages, data structures, algorithms, design patterns, and software architecture. Understand how different technologies and tools work together.

Practice: Practice solving a wide variety of coding problems, ranging from basic to complex. Platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and Codeforces offer a wealth of coding challenges to hone your problem-solving skills.

Study Algorithms and Data Structures: Familiarize yourself with common algorithms and data structures. Understand their time and space complexity and how to apply them in different scenarios.

Learn from Others: Study and analyze solutions from experienced developers and open-source projects. Understand their thought processes and the reasons behind their design decisions.

Work on Real Projects: Apply your knowledge to real-world projects. Building complete software systems will expose you to a wide range of challenges and help you understand the complexities of software development.

Collaborate and Seek Feedback: Work in teams and collaborate with others. Seeking feedback on your code and solutions will help you improve and learn from different perspectives.

Embrace Challenges: Don't shy away from difficult problems. Embrace challenges as opportunities to grow and learn. Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable tasks.

Continuous Learning: Stay updated with the latest technologies and industry trends. Attend conferences, webinars, and workshops to expand your knowledge.
