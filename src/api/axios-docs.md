**Interceptors**: functions that you can use to intercept a request or a response before being handled by the axios instance.
Interceptors allow you to modify the request or response data, add headers, handle errors, and perform the pre/post-processing
tasks in a centralized and reliable way


There are two types of interceptors:
- Request
- Response: allow you to handle errors, modify the response data, or perform any required post-processing.
