Time-Based Access Control:
Time-based access control restricts access to resources based on time windows or validity periods. For example, a user might have access to specific resources only during certain hours of the day.

<!--
Attribute-Based Dynamic Access Control (ABAC with XACML):
This approach extends ABAC with policies defined in the eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML). Policies are evaluated at runtime, and access decisions consider user attributes, environmental factors, and resource properties.

State Management:

Error Handling and Logging:

Optimize perf: Code splitting, lazy loading, memoization, debounce, load times

Testing: Unit tests
